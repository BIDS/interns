### Rose-bud-thorn

#### 🌹
* I drafted a post for the CLEAN event from last week, and I really like how a lot of my classes tie back into these topics. 
Many of my classes discuss similar topics about data availability, visualization and storytelling, and how data is gathered and distributed, so it's cool to see real world applications.

#### 🌱
* It seems like there are a lot of events coming up, which is very exciting!

#### 🌵   
* I feel like I haven't gotten into a routine with my class schedule being in flux - but hopefully things should smooth out starting next week.
