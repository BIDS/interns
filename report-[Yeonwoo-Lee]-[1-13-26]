### Rose-bud-thorn

#### 🌹
* This week, I liked getting to introduce myself to a lot of different people in the BIDS team through reaching out to collect their headshots. 

#### 🌱
* I am excited to finish up my blog post and get started on new material next week. 

#### 🌵   
* When I reached out to some people for their headshots they did not reply, so it made collecting everyone's much harder.
* I am also still figuring out GitHub and there have been a few hiccups.
