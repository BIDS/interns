* Working on finishing up the Walsh Blog Post
  I am wrapping up the Walsh blog post and transferring content into a news article on the BIDS website. 
  Reflecting back, learning the process of drafting a BIDS blog post including revisions and final publication was awesome!

#### 🌵 Thorn
* Creating a news content item on the BIDS website can be a bit challenging when it comes to formatting. 
It's important to make sure that no extra HTML tags are created when copy-pasting content. I am still exploring ways to paste content directly as plain text.
A big thank you to LWH for helping me understand the process!
