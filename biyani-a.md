* Working on revising the Waller Lab paper Blog post

#### 🌱 Bud

#### 🌵 Thorn
* The Waller Lab paper blog post took me extra time initially because of the technical concepts.  
  It was a bit difficult to determine how much technical language and knowledge to include in the blog post while also keeping in mind length & context. 
  I hope to get some revisions to help me understand what others think & how I can improve my draft.

* Creating a news content item on the BIDS website can be a bit challenging when it comes to formatting. 
  It's important to make sure that no extra HTML tags are created when copy-pasting content.
