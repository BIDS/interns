# Tyler Hawthonrne

## w/c 30 June 2025

### Rose-bud-thorn

#### üåπ
* Writing the BIDS last blog post about the final day of the panel was a satisfying and engaging task.
  I enjoy this kind of work, as it allows me to better try and understand the many different projects under BIDS and Open Source as a whole. 

#### üå±
* I learned a lot about The Turing Way and GitHub both as a platform and as a participant. I am still far from proficient, and still need a lot of training, but I feel better suited to write about the platforms and hopefully make some contributions of my own.

#### üåµ   
* Also regarding The Turing Way, I struggled to make a pull request for an issue with merging two chapters in the novel. I definitely need some help and need to learn more before making an actual contribution.
