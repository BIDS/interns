#### 🌹
* This week, I liked getting to introduce myself to a lot of different people in the BIDS team through reaching out to collect their headshots. 

#### 🌱
* I am excited to finish up my blog post and get started on new material next week. 

#### 🌵   
* When I reached out to some people for their headshots they did not reply, so it made collecting everyone's much harder.

# Legend

## Introduction

This is the legend of the templates for the weekly reports that the BIDS interns will be working on. The weekly reports are to be completed every week, keeping the latest report on the top, with older reports below in chronological order.

## Formating

### Housekeeping
* Leave one blank line after each section to keep the report easy to read on GitHub.
* Make sure to start another numbered line after each complete sentence, to make it easy to keep track of the lines. 
* Period after every complete sentence.
* Names in Initials
* Put the latest report at the top so we can scroll down to the oldest reports, starting from the first week.
  
### Basic Syntax
* For the subtitles, use hashtags + space + subtitle.
  * "# A first-level heading"
  * "## A second-level heading"
  * "### A third-level heading"
* Styling
  * Bold: **This is bold text** (or Command+B (Mac) or Ctrl+B (Windows/Linux))
  * Italic: _This text is italicized_ (or Command+i or Ctrl+i)
  * All Bold and Italic: ***All this text is important***
  * Subscript: This is a <sub>subscript</sub> text.
  * Underline: 	This is an <ins>underlined</ins> text.
* Quoting
  * Quoting text: use >
    * > Text that is a quote.
  * Quoting code in a sentence: use single backticks ` ` (or Command+E (Mac) or Ctrl+E (Windows/Linux))
  * Quoting an entire block of codes or commands: use triple backticks ``` ```
* Links
  * Link text in brackets [ ], and the URL in parenthesis ()

* Emoji: use a colon : and the name of your emoji, typing the colon and a letter will pull up a list of recommended emojis.
* Footnotes: [^1] after the content, and then start a new line, add your notes after [^1]:
