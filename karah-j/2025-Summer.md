### Rose-bud-thorn

#### 🌹
* Working on icebreakers for the BCEN retreat was a highlight.
  It gave me a chance to be both creative and thoughtful, and it felt good to design something small that could help set the tone for a welcoming and energizing event.

#### 🌱
* I'm excited to write a post about the Scientific Python event, especially the statistics portion, because Python isn’t usually easily aligned with stats work.
  It feels important and surprisingly approachable for me.

#### 🌹
* Looking through BIDS-related research exposed me to some nuanced ways AI and data are being used as problem solvers.
  It was interesting to see how different projects define their impact, and it gave me a more diverse understanding of the roles these tools can play across disciplines.

#### 🌱
* We've been experimenting with different ways of formatting seminar insights, but still figuring out what's most useful to highlight and how to balance detail with clarity.

#### 🌹
* Writing up insights from the seminar series was fun! 
  I used code to surface patterns in the data, which I haven't done in a while outside of organizational tasks. 
  It felt nice to apply those skills toward something reflective and analytical.

#### 🌱
* The OSPO Meetup sparked some ideas/possibilities about broader cross-campus collaborations. 
  I'm still getting my bearings on how these kinds of relationships and meetings typically move forward, but it was helpful to get an initial look into what's happening in that space.

#### 🌵   
* After more than two years of searching for a way to automate buying perishable goods, I may have finally come across a promising lead.

#### 🌹
* Organizing the BIDS photo folder was a satisfying task. 
  I enjoy this kind of detailed work, and it gave me a chance to think about additional ways the folder could be organized or made more useful going forward.

#### 🌱
* I explored OtterAI as a potential tool for future captioning needs. 
  From my testing, it seems noticeably more accurate than Adobe Premiere, which opens up some promising possibilities, though we must pay for the services ($8 a month for 10 videos)

#### 🌵   
* Coordinating schedules with one individual has taken more than a couple of emails, which I completely understand.
