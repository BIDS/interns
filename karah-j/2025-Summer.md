#### üåπ
* Creating the BIDMaP grant summary was one of my favorite things to work on this week because it requires focus, precision, and a bit of research sleuthing.
  I enjoy finding opportunities like this and putting together concise summaries so everyone can quickly assess relevance without having to dig through the full materials themselves.
