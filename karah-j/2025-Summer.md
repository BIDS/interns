#### üåπ
* Writing up insights from the seminar series was fun! 
  I used code to surface patterns in the data, which I haven't done in a while outside of organizational tasks. 
  It felt nice to apply those skills toward something reflective and analytical.

#### üå±
* The OSPO Meetup sparked some ideas/possibilities about broader cross-campus collaborations. 
  I'm still getting my bearings on how these kinds of relationships and meetings typically move forward, but it was helpful to get an initial look into what's happening in that space.

#### üåµ   
* After more than two years of searching for a way to automate buying perishable goods, I may have finally come across a promising lead. 
  But the person who knows more hasn't responded yet, so while I'm hopeful, the wait has definitely made this feel like a bit of a thorn.

#### üåπ
* Organizing the BIDS photo folder was a satisfying task. 
  I enjoy this kind of detailed work, and it gave me a chance to think about additional ways the folder could be organized or made more useful going forward.

#### üå±
* I explored OtterAI as a potential tool for future captioning needs. 
  From my testing, it seems noticeably more accurate than Adobe Premiere, which opens up some promising possibilities, though we must pay for the services ($8 a month for 10 videos)

#### üåµ   
* Coordinating schedules with one individual has taken more than a couple of emails, which I completely understand. 
  Still, I'm hoping to get something confirmed soon so everyone can move forward with the project rather than feel like they need to keep checking in with me about their availability.

#### üåπ
