## w/c 16 June 2025

### Rose-bud-thorn

#### üåπ
* Coordinating various packed schedules for an upcoming meeting was challenging, but I feel lucky that everyone was open to moving things around. Despite how busy they are, I was able to get the meeting on the calendar, which made my life a lot easier and the coordination successful.

#### üå±
* I had a sitdown meeting with KW and KC where I learned a lot about open data science and BIDS, including some of the more technical aspects of their impact. It gave me a deeper understanding of the goals BIDS works toward and the values it represents. I'm looking forward to continuing to be part of this work.

#### üåµ
